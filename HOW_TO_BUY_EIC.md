---

## Overview

Welcome! This document explains how to acquire and trade **Energy Intelligence Coin (EIC)** on the **Base Mainnet** network.

## 1. Wallet Requirements

To buy or trade EIC, you must use a crypto wallet that supports the **Base** network.

Examples:
- MetaMask
- Coinbase Wallet
- Rabby Wallet

If you are bridging from Ethereum Mainnet, bridge your ETH into **Base** before swapping.  
Wallet must be connected to the Base network in order to transact.

## 2. Verify the Official EIC Contract

Before you swap any tokens, make sure you verify the **official EIC contract address**:

1. Use the contract address published in this repository.
2. Cross-check on BaseScan.
3. Confirm token name, symbol, and decimals match what is documented here.

⚠️ **Never trust a contract address copied from social media comments.**

   - **To:** EIC
4. Adjust slippage tolerance as needed.
5. Confirm and submit the transaction.

## 4. Method B — Provide Liquidity (Advanced)

If you want to participate deeper:

1. Supply **equal values** of WETH and EIC into the liquidity pool.
2. Deposit them into the **WETH/EIC pool**.
3. Receive Liquidity Provider (LP) tokens.

💡 Important: **LP tokens represent ownership of pooled assets — they are not EIC themselves.**
